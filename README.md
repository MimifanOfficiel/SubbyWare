# SubbyWare

# No release at the moment, only current source code is available

## What's this ?
  
  SubbyWare is a software made to be the new [Edgeware](https://github.com/PetitTournesol/Edgeware) <br>
  It is made for people feeling submissive but who doesn't have a master/mistress to be cared by. <br>
  It's supposed to work so you will be kind of controlled, humiliated and such by someone, but it will be SubbyWare :) <br>
  
## How to use ?
  Download the release file.exe and run it! <br>
  You will have multiple tabs, the more important ones are Main, Config and Presets. <br>
  - The Main tab allows you to setup things about the software running.
  - The Config tab is to change your preset configuration, so you can set your preferences on the software's behaviour.
  - The Preset tab is to create, quickly edit or remove your presets.
  <br>
  Once everything is set up, go to the main tab and click run, then have fun :)
